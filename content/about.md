# About the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Think of it as the "USB-C of AI integrations" - a universal connector that standardizes how AI systems interact with the world around them.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Communication**: MCP provides a common protocol for AI models to interact with tools and services
- **Tool Discovery**: AI models can dynamically discover available tools and their capabilities
- **Context Management**: MCP enables effective management of context between models and external systems
- **Security-First Design**: Built with robust security features, including OAuth 2.1 support
- **Open Standard**: Anyone can implement MCP servers and clients

## Architectural Components

MCP consists of several key architectural components:

### MCP Clients

MCP clients are AI-powered applications that follow the MCP specification to connect with MCP servers. Examples include:

- Claude Desktop
- Custom AI assistants
- IDE plugins
- Business applications with AI capabilities

### MCP Servers

MCP servers expose tools, resources, and prompts that MCP clients can interact with. Servers can provide:

- Access to databases and data sources
- Integration with business tools
- Custom functions and capabilities
- Domain-specific information

### Protocol Elements

Within the MCP architecture, there are three main elements:

1. **Tools**: Function-like capabilities that LLMs can invoke to perform actions or computations
2. **Resources**: Data sources that LLMs can access, similar to GET endpoints in a REST API
3. **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates to use tools or resources in the most optimal way

## Why Use MCP?

MCP solves several critical challenges in the AI ecosystem:

- **Reduces Integration Complexity**: Instead of building custom integrations for each AI model and tool combination, developers can build once to a standard protocol
- **Improves AI Capabilities**: By connecting AI models to real-time data and tools, MCP enables more powerful and useful AI applications
- **Encourages Innovation**: As an open standard, MCP enables a diverse ecosystem of tools and applications
- **Enhances User Experience**: Users benefit from AI models that can seamlessly access the information they need
