# Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

## What Problem Does MCP Solve?

Large language models (LLMs) like Claude and ChatGPT have revolutionized how we interact with technology, yet they've remained confined to static knowledge and isolated interfaces. The Model Context Protocol breaks down these barriers, enabling AI to seamlessly integrate with real-world data and tools.

Think of MCP like USB for AI integrations:

- Before standards like USB, connecting peripherals required a mess of different ports and custom drivers
- Similarly, integrating AI applications with external tools and systems is an "M?N problem"
- If you have M different AI applications and N different tools/systems, you might need to build M?N different integrations
- MCP transforms this into an "M+N problem" - tool creators build N MCP servers, while application developers build M MCP clients

## Key Components of MCP

MCP consists of three main components:

1. **Tools**: Function-like capabilities that LLMs can invoke to perform actions or computations
2. **Resources**: Data sources that LLMs can access, similar to GET endpoints in a REST API
3. **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates to use tools or resources in the most optimal way

## Getting Started with MCP

To start using MCP, you'll need to:

1. Set up an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop)
2. Create or connect to MCP servers for your data sources and tools
3. Configure the connection between your client and servers

In future tutorials, we'll explore each of these steps in detail and show you how to build your first MCP-powered application.
