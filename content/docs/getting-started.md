# Getting Started with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This guide will help you understand the basics of the Model Context Protocol and how to start using it in your projects.

## What You'll Need

- Basic understanding of APIs and protocols
- Familiarity with at least one programming language (Python examples provided)
- Access to Claude Desktop or another MCP client for testing

## Understanding MCP Components

Before diving into code, it's important to understand the key components of the Model Context Protocol:

### 1. MCP Clients

MCP clients are applications that connect to MCP servers to access their tools, resources, and prompts. Examples include:

- Claude Desktop
- Custom applications using an MCP client library
- IDE extensions that leverage MCP

### 2. MCP Servers

MCP servers expose functionality to MCP clients through a standardized interface. An MCP server can provide:

- **Tools**: Function-like capabilities that LLMs can invoke
- **Resources**: Data sources that LLMs can access
- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates for using tools and resources

### 3. The Protocol

The Model Context Protocol defines how clients and servers communicate, including:

- Message formats
- Discovery mechanisms
- Authentication and security
- Error handling

## Installation

To get started with MCP development, you'll typically need to install an MCP client or server library. For Python development, you can use:

```bash
pip install mcp[cli]
```

This installs the official Python MCP library with CLI tools.

## Setting Up Your First MCP Server

Here's a simple example of a "Hello World" MCP server using Python:

```python
from mcp import BaseModel, Field, JSONSchema, Response, Server, Tool, router
from typing import Annotated

# Define a request model
class GreetingRequest(BaseModel):
    name: Annotated[
        str,
        Field(description="The name of the person to greet"),
    ]

# Define a tool
@router.tool(
    "greeting",
    "Says hello to the specified person",
    request_schema=JSONSchema.from_type(GreetingRequest),
)
async def greeting(request: GreetingRequest) -> Response:
    return Response({"greeting": f"Hello, {request.name}!"})

# Create and run the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = Server(tools=[greeting])
    server.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

Save this as `hello_server.py` and run it with:

```bash
python hello_server.py
```

This will start an MCP server on localhost:8000 with a single "greeting" tool.

## Connecting to Claude Desktop

To test your MCP server with Claude Desktop:

1. Start Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > MCP Servers
3. Click "Add Server"
4. Enter `http://localhost:8000` as the server URL
5. Click "Connect"

Once connected, you can ask Claude to use your tool:

> "Can you greet John using the greeting tool?"

Claude will respond with:

> "I'll use the greeting tool to say hello to John.
>
> The greeting is: Hello, John!"

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first MCP server, you can:

1. Explore the [MCP Python SDK documentation](https://docs.mcp.anthropic.com/python)
2. Check out more complex examples in our [Examples section](/examples)
3. Learn about [advanced MCP features](/docs/advanced-features)
4. Start integrating MCP into your own projects

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Connection Refused**: Make sure your server is running and the port is not blocked by a firewall
- **Authentication Errors**: Verify your authentication settings if you're using secured servers
- **Tool Not Found**: Ensure the tool name in your request matches the registered tool name
